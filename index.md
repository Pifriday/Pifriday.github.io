This app was created during my internship at Axle Informatics. Because scientists and lab technicians oftentimes spend many hours in their labs, they can find it tedious to stop what theyâ€™re doing to put in requests to replace broken biomedical instruments. This mobile app was designed to help researchers quickly request repairs / new machines by scanning QR codes that are placed on existing instruments. After scanning the instrument's code, users would be shown the exact model of the instrument and be brought to a page where they can process the order.

__Frontend:__ Ionic, Angular

__Backend:__ Express.js, MongoDB

## Coursework
